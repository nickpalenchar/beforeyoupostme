      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>BeforeYouPost.Me is a theraputic site where you are free to post whatever is on your mind to oblivion, rather
      than your social network.</p>
      <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
      <p>Isn't it funny how something starts to grow in our mind, and we just <em>have</em> to rant about it on Facebook?
      While it seems like a good idea at the time, many of us regret posting a highly emotional status after the fact.</p>
      
      <p>There's plenty of articles about "Facebook envy," such as <a href="http://sploid.gizmodo.com/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-take-peoples-lives-in-facebook-1595563358">this</a>,
      <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2088074/Facebook-makes-sad-Pictures-make-people-jealous-other.html">this</a>,
      or <a href="http://karynemlira.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Envy-on-Facebook_A-Hidden-Threat-to-Users%E2%80%99-Life.pdf"> even this scholorly one</a>.
     Sometimes it's Facebook envy that drives us to passive-aggressively post our own rant (sometimes it's external).</p>
     
     <p>This kind of oversharring can trigger undesired reactions in your friends, affecting the moods of those you did not intend. It can start the wrong type of dialogue that only makes you (and others) feel worse.</p>
     
     <h3>If oversharing is bad, why do we do it?</h3>
     <p>Before everyone was connected on Facebook, we had real friends that we interacted with in small groups or even on a one-on-one basis.
     This was the ideal context--a place where you could let out what is on your mind to some close loved ones who you knew were listening. Today, Facebook creates an illusion of being heard.
         That innocent-looking box just casually asking <strong>"what's on your mind?"</strong> is drawing you in. The only problem is you're no longer discussing your feelings to a few close friends ready to listen, but tossing it to the mercy of 200+ random profiles, all whose users are concerned with their own business.</p>
    <p></p>
    
    <h3>How does BYPM help me with this emotional affliction?</h3>
          <p>Most of the time, all we need is the act of writting it out. This could also work in a diary, but in order to satisfy our tech-driven minds, BYPM immitates the framiliar look of a Facebook share box. We add an additional layer of beheiver, allowing you to go through the same motions as you would to actually share a status.</p>
          <p>Additionally, guided meditation prompts uses some basic meditation techniques to further help you release your emotions.</p>
    
    <h3>How does BYPM help <em>others</em> with their emotional affliction?</h3>
    <p>By posting to BYPM, you are choosing not to become a statistic. Every rant, complaint, and humblebrag that gets posted here reduces the noise on Facebook. Others may not notice this directly, but their emotional soul is thanking you. And <strong>I</strong> am thanking you!</p>
    
    <h3>Where is my status posted to?</h3>
    Oblivion! That's right, your status is in no way retained, be it  in this site internally or any public social network. That's the beauty of it.
    
    <h3>I have a friend that needs this.</h3>
          <p>That's great! Please let them know about <a href="index.htm">beforeyoupost.me</a></p>
